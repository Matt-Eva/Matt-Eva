# Matt Eva

Hello there! I'm Matt. I'm a software engineer and technical writer - I like coding and writing about code!

## What I use

Here's a more or less comprehensive list of the languages and technologies that I have used in the past and currently use. 

I've definitely hopped around quite a bit on my learning journey, but there are so many cool things to learn and build with! I like having at least a cursory understanding of languages, tools, and ecosystems so that I can pick the right tool for the job, and get quickly up to speed when working with a team. (Also learning is fun!)

### Programming languages

- Go, JavaScript / TypeScript, Python, Ruby

### Frontend Frameworks / Tools

- HTML, CSS, React, React-Router, Redux, Vue

### Backend Frameworks / Tools

- Gorilla, Express, Flask, Ruby on Rails

### Databases

I'm a bit of a database nerd! I hopped on the NoSQL hype train when I was still learning to write basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have been deep diving into different database paradigms since. I do still love good ole' SQL though!

- Relational Databases (SQL), Neo4j / Memgraph (Cypher), MongoDB, Cassandra (CQL)

### Developer Tools

- Git, GitHub

## What I'm Learning

I'm currently learning Docker!
